# ⚽ Premier League Standings Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts Premier League standings using historical match data and advanced statistical modeling techniques.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the final Premier League standings for a given season by analyzing historical match data, team performance metrics, and various statistical indicators. Using machine learning algorithms, we build predictive models that can forecast team positions, points totals, and overall league table outcomes based on patterns observed in past seasons.

The project combines data science techniques with football analytics to provide insights into team performance trends and season outcomes, making it valuable for sports analysts, football enthusiasts, and anyone interested in predictive modeling in sports.

## 📊 Data Source

The historical match data used in this project is obtained from **Football Datasets**, a comprehensive repository of football-related datasets.

**Source**: [https://github.com/datasets/football-datasets](https://github.com/datasets/football-datasets?tab=readme-ov-file#football-datasets)

The dataset includes:

- ⚽ Match results from multiple Premier League seasons
- 📈 Team statistics (goals scored, goals conceded, wins, draws, losses)
- 📅 Date and venue information
- 🏆 Historical league standings
- 📊 Additional performance metrics and team attributes
