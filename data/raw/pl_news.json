    "text": "Further:\n\n&gt; Obviously, the headline-grabbing decision was dropping Salah. When he did so, no one thoroughly analysing performances this season felt that was the wrong call. Slot had to act, and taking such a drastic and brave decision could be interpreted that even he knew time was running out.\n\n&gt; What no one foresaw was the impact of the Salah interview and what a difference that has made. Once Salah spoke out, just like the supporters, Liverpool’s executives were never going to back the player over the manager.\n\n&gt; There might be no way back for Salah now he is heading to the Africa Cup of Nations, but I genuinely hope there is. Even though I have been furious about what he said last weekend, it would be an absolute travesty if that interview is remembered as his last meaningful act for Liverpool. He has done too much for the club for that to be so. He owes it to himself to make sure he is afforded a farewell fit for a legend – whenever that might be. If that means he has to apologise, so be it.\n\n&gt; As things stand, it would be no surprise if Liverpool sold Salah to fund another spree in January because the lack of resources on the substitutes bench in midweek was extraordinary given how much was spent last summer. That was a key takeaway from another dramatic Anfield week.\n\n&gt; Slot’s squad is weaker than it should be.\n\n&gt; The past two weeks have at least demonstrated that the same cannot be said of the manager.",

A 21-year-old Maccabi fan is being investigated because he is said to have shown the police a Hitler salute on the way to the stadium. In addition, the focus is on the songs of some of the approximately 400 fans of the team from Tel Aviv, who met at the fan meeting point in the castle garden: There are said to have been defamatory lines. When asked, the police confirmed that one of the songs - which is said to have been chanted during riots in Amsterdam - allegedly contained the lyrics \"In Gaza there are no more schools because there are no children anymore\" - a cruel allusion to the Gaza war. The other had misogynistic fantasies of violence and rape - combined with the contempt of Arabs. It is being investigated in close coordination with the public prosecutor's office. The police took pictures of the fan meeting when the lyrics were sung to preserve evidence. These are now being evaluated.",
