    "text": "Without even being asked about Arne Slot, he offered up that his relationship with the Dutchman had completely broken down and revealed that he had asked his parents to attend next Saturday’s visit of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, admitting it could be his Anfield farewell as “someone doesn’t want me in the club”. He left the door open to a possible January move. It was incendiary.\n\nThis was no angry rant. The third-highest goalscorer in the club’s history was calm and composed throughout. “Thank you, guys,” he said at the end of a remarkable seven-and-a-half minutes.\n\nAs Salah walked away, he left a towering inferno in his wake.\n\nHis pride has been severely dented and you can see why he feels that he has been unfairly singled out. He is the only player to start the humiliating home defeats to Nottingham Forest and PSV who has been benched since.\n\nSalah must sit and watch the blundering Ibrahima Konate and wonder why he has been treated so differently. The same goes for Cody Gakpo, who has consistently under-performed wide on the left but has bizarrely retained his place.\n\nBut that still does not excuse Salah’s decision to go nuclear.\n\nSalah’s comments showed a glaring lack of self-awareness regarding his form this season. “I don’t know why this is happening to me,” he said.  “I have done so much for this club. I don’t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it.”\n\nNo, it doesn’t work like that. You have to *keep* earning it and the reality is that, when Slot dropped Salah for the game at West Ham, there were few dissenting voices. That’s because he’s been so ineffective — contributing just five goals and three assists in 19 appearances in all competitions.\n\nFar too often he has been on the periphery of matches. He has offered little threat going forward and opponents have repeatedly targeted the space in behind him because he does not track back to help out his right-back defensively.",
